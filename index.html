    <h1>Fighting Police Brutality</h1>
    
    <p>
      About 1000 people are killed each year by police in the US.
      Out of that, “Black men are 2.5 times more likely than white men to be 
      killed by police during their lifetime.”  On top of that The black men 
      who are killed are twice as likely to be unarmed than white men who are killed by police.
      That's an absurd statistic.  The ratio of white to black police is about 3 : 1.  
      That can't be right. Right? <!-- Made with <a href="https://glitch.com">Glitch</a>!-->
