    <p>
      There are many problems with police body cams.  One of the problems is that it's difficult for the public to get access to the videos.  In 2017, 40 out of 100 body cam videos of fatal shootings were available to the public.   <!-- Made with <a href="https://glitch.com">Glitch</a>!-->

      Body cams are supposed to stop police from committing crimes and they do work sometimes.  For example in 2017, a police body cam caught an officer planting drugs at a crime scene and he was convicted for fabricating evidence.  Former police officer Betsy Smith with almost 30 years of experience says “You forget about the body camera pretty quickly.”  Police usually just go about their usual job even with the body cam on because they forget that it's on.
